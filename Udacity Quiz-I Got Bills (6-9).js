/*
 * Programming Quiz: I Got Bills (6-9)
 *
 * Use the .map() method to take the bills array below and create a second array
 * of numbers called totals. The totals array should contains each amount from the
 * bills array but with a 15% tip added. Log the totals array to the console.
 *
 * For example, the first two entries in the totals array would be:
 *
 * [57.76, 21.99, ... ]
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - each entry in the totals array must be a number
 *  - each number must have an accuracy of two decimal points

  99.22,
  102.2,

  6.77,
  2.22

var totals = bills.map(function(bill) {
  bill += bill * 0.15;
  return Number(bill.toFixed(2)); //We need to number value and need 2 decimal points so we hae to use toFixed() method.
});
console.log(totals);
